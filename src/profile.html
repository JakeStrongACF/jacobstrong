        Hello, My name is Jacob Strong. I am a senior at PSU. I am graduating in
        winter 2023. I have many professional skills gained from a wide variety
        of jobs. My profession hope is to acquire a job in the tech sector after
        graduation. While I have worked for software companies it has been in a
        marketing capacity so I'm excited to see those jobs from a software
        engineer perspective. I choose to keep this as my photo due to the term
        I've had.
